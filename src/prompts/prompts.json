The broad grid of religion for overall human developent was the same but there were different emphases to suit varying socio-cultural , economic and political development. The guidance was conveyed by role models (Prophets)among human beings throughout the world. Religion is thus the very basis of human civilization. There were 124,000 Prophets and Messengers of God with Adam and Eve receiving the first revelations from God Almighty. Having tremendous scriptural resources and having gone through tremendous historical experiences, humankind needed one quantum leap to bring it into the ages of knowledge and science away from the dark age of superstitions and fantasies. This global impetus was created by Islam. Not only did Islam teach the world new ideas, new laws and new sciences, it also tapped the wisdom of the ancient and contemporary civilizations, corrected and developed them even further.

In ancient times Jainism was known by many names such as Saman tradition, the religion of Nirgantha, or Jina. Literally Jina means a conqueror, that is one that has conquered the worldly passions like desire, hatred, anger, greed and pride by one's own personal efforts and has thereby freed `his' soul from the karmas obscuring knowledge, perception, truth, and ability. The ultimate goal of Jains is to rid the soul of all karmas and attain liberation. The main principles of Jainism are Ahimsa (non-violence), Anekantvad (multiplicity of views) and Aparigraha (non-possessiveness). The Jain code of conduct is made up of five vows - Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Aseteya (non-stealing), Aparigraha (non-possessiveness) and Brahmacharya (chastity). Non-violence (Ahimsa) is upheld as the supreme religion and is practiced in all forms; mental (maan), verbal (vachaan), and physical (kaya), both knowingly and unknowingly. Jains have a deep compassion for all forms of life. It believes in equality of souls, irrespective of differing physical forms, ranging from human beings to animals and even microscopic living organisms.

Taoism encompasses both Philosophical Taoism and Religious Taoism. Philosophical Taoism is based on the teachings and ideas of Lao Zi (\u8001\u5b50), Zhuang Zi (\u5e84\u5b50), and other Taoist philosophers. Religious Taoism, which includes worship and rituals, originated since Celestial Master Zhang Dao Ling (\u5f20\u9053\u9675\u5929\u5e08) extablished the Five Pecks of Rice Tradition (\u4e94\u6597\u7c73\u9053) some 1,900 years ago during the reign of Emperor Shun-di of the Eastern Han Dynasty (AD 126-144).

There are two main schools of Taoism. One is the Zheng-yi tradition (Orthodox Oneness) (\u6b63\u4e00\u6d3e), also known as the Celestial Masters tradition (\u5929\u5e08\u6d3e), founded by Celestial Master Zhang Dao Ling; and the other is Quan-zhen tradition (\u5168\u771f\u6d3e) founded by Wang Chong Yang.
